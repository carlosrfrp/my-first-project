# About my first project on GitHub
A program in progress that will read the weight of a package of breakast cereal
in ounces and output the weight in metric tons as well as the number of boxes needed
to yield 1 metric ton of cereal. Your program should allow the user to repeat this
calculation as often as the user wishes.
